<h1><p>Chickens</p></h1>
<h2><p>Introduction</p></h2>
The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl originally from Southeastern Asia. 
Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. 
<p>An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. </p>
<h3><p>Idea</p></h3>
Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period 
(4thâ€“2nd centuries BC).[1][2] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.
